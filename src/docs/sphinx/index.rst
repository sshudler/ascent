========
Ascent
========

A many-core capable lightweight in-situ visualization and analysis infrastructure for multi-physics HPC simulations.

Introduction
============

Ascent is a system designed to meet the in-situ visualization and analysis needs of simulation code teams running multi-physics calculations on many-core HPC architectures. It provides rendering runtimes that can leverage many-core CPUs and GPUs to render images of simulation meshes.

Ascent focuses on ease of use and reduced integration burden for simulation code teams.

- It does not require GUI or system-graphics libraries.
- It includes integration examples that demonstrate how to use Ascent inside  three HPC-simulation proxy applications.
- It provides a built-in web server that supports streaming rendered images directly to a web browser.
